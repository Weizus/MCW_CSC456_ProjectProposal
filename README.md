# Pitch 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people have become more concerned about their privacy. To adapt to the growing digital climate, people need more options for standardized verification and identity control. The idea is to create a <b>blockchain based verification system</b> that allows individuals to hold onto their data within a digital wallet, and prove their credentials without need for revealing more than necessary.

# Description
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A system either centralized or decentralized that allows for a number of people's data to be securely stashed into a form of digital wallet that gives them or an entity control of what data is shown at any given moment; Specific sharing of data, meaning, instead of sending an entire file on someone, we can easily display just a state id or degree to specific entities/people. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A system like this can also make traversing the digital landscape easier for students, members of government, or corporate settings. For students, imagine your college giving you both a physical and official, credited, one of one, digital degree that you can access at any time and can be easily sent to any employer or university. For members of government, we can guarentee they have access to only what they're allowed to see; For any specific amount of time. Corporate benefits from this byproduct also and in addition employees can find use with a digital ID they can swipe and access from their phones using some NFC add-on to the ecosystem.
